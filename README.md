- Expression: any valid unit of code that resolves to a value or produces a value. It can be a number or string, or a function call that returns a value.
- Statement: an instruction that performs an action. e.g. let sum = num + 5; // Statement and num + 5 is an expression. It may contain expressions, but its main purpose is to control the flow of the program, rather than to produce a value.
- The conditional or ternary operator
